    {q:"Why is gravitational potential negative near a planet when zero is chosen at infinity?",a:"Because energy must be supplied to move a mass from the bound position to infinity; the bound position is below the zero reference."},
    {q:"A satellite moves to a higher circular orbit. What happens to speed and total energy?",a:"Speed decreases; total energy increases toward zero (becomes less negative)."},
    {q:"Why does a magnetic field not change the speed of a charged particle when v is perpendicular to B?",a:"The magnetic force is perpendicular to velocity, so it does no work."},
    {q:"What graph would you use in RP9 to obtain RC from a discharge?",a:"Plot ln(V/V₀) against t; gradient = −1/RC."},
    {q:"Why does high-voltage transmission reduce power loss?",a:"For the same transmitted power, higher voltage gives lower current; cable loss I²R therefore falls strongly."},
    {q:"When is induced emf zero for a rotating coil?",a:"When flux linkage is at a maximum or minimum because its instantaneous rate of change is zero."},
    {q:"State the difference between electric potential and electric field strength.",a:"Potential is scalar work per unit charge; field strength is vector force per unit positive charge."}
